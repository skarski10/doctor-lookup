## Description

_Create a website where users may enter a medical issue (ie: “toothache”) into a form, submit it, and receive a list of doctors they may seek out to help with their medical issue.

Use the BetterDoctors API to retrieve this information. You will need to make an account and an API key. Do not use someone else’s API key. Each API key can be invoked for 1000 API calls per day, so avoid making excessive API calls (ie: accidental infinite loops) during development._

## Setup/Installation Requirements
#### Creating API Keys

* _Visit the BetterDoctors API site and click “Get a free API key”._
* _Fill out the form and authenticate with GitHub._
* _Your API key should be listed on the front page (ex: “a2c356ibgh44…..”) or under My Account > Applications._

#### Setup Instructions

* _Place your token in an .env file at the top level of your directory. (For grading purposes, name your API key variable exports.apiKey in .env. Keep spelling and capitalization identical, as it considerably speeds up the grading process.)_
* _Include .env in .gitignore._
